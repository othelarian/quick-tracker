title: Quick Tracker plugin
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

! What this plugin do?

I always wanting a task tracker / todo list, but I also have some prerequisites: 

* a tracker forgettable, like you know it's there, but it's not obviously visible
* still quickly accessible, in one click I can reach it
* without working with tags, to avoid polluting TW5 working a lot with tags
* story unrelated, to avoid loosing it inside, I wanted something I can invoke and then revoke easily
* self contained, with minimum impact on tiddlers created inside the TW5 to make it work (only one tiddler is overwritten to save configuration)
* with priority system integrated and configurable

That's quite a lot in fact, but I was ready to invest time in it ;-) 

! I want to try it!

! Installation

Drag'n'drop the link below to get the Quick Tracker plugin:

$:/plugins/othy/quick-tracker

! Associated history

There is a little bit of history behind this plugin. In fact, I was starting my entity-manager plugin, and I feel the need to have a better task tracker than the one I previously built with Shiraz plugin. As I was looking forward to a better solution I tought "this will be a great way to learn a lot and make some tests to start entity-manager with some solid foundation". So [[Quick Tracker plugin]] started as a prototype inside the entity-manager project, and then I forked it in its own repository as it became clearer that this plugin was now big enough to have its own repository.

! Still in progress

This plugin IS NOT USABLE right now. I have a lot to do to make it work properly. But I'm getting closer.

Things I have to do:

* apply priority style inside the showItem macro (manager.tid)
* use priority to sort lists
* add to customizer a reset button
* add a standard 3 priorities button to customizer
* build the short list in the sidebar tracker -> test with priorities
* insert statistics about task completion
* delete priority
* set custom color for each priority
* define default piority to use
* change priority by group (checkboxed)
* write "I want to try it!"
* github page
